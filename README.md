- Admin can change the status of record to either **under investigation, rejected** (in the event of a false claim) or **resolved** (in the event that the claim has been investigated and resolved).
- User can add Images or Videos to their **red-flag** or **intervention** records, to support their claims.
- The application should display a Google Map with Marker showing the red-flag or intervention location.

- User can only change the geolocation of a red-flag/intervention record when the record's status is yet to be marked as either **under investigation, rejected, or resolved**.
- User can only edit or delete a red-flag/intervention record when the record's status is yet to be marked as either **under investigation, rejected, or resolved**.
